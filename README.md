# CubicOptimal0.2
After a long time away, I am starting to work on this again. It's final goal is to be an optimal solver, but it's a winding path. I'm doing experimenting, and building out where I like. Expect very dynamic code; I'm changing a lot of things, including class names and project architecture.
